## Worktree & Agent Model

Each agent runs in its own Git Worktree on a dedicated branch.
Agents never share a working directory.

**Branch naming:**
```
agent/<project>/<scope>
```

**Creating a worktree:**
Run this from the repo root before starting any agent task:
```
git worktree add worktrees/<project>-<scope> -b agent/<project>/<scope>
```

Examples:
```
git worktree add worktrees/client-ui -b agent/client/ui
git worktree add worktrees/backend-api -b agent/backend/api
git worktree add worktrees/backend-auth -b agent/backend/auth
```

Then open Claude Code inside the created worktree folder.
The `worktrees/` folder is local only - listed in `.gitignore`, never committed.

**Context loads in this order:**
1. Root `CLAUDE.md` - always auto-loaded
2. `<project>/CLAUDE.md` - auto-loaded per worktree
3. `agents/<NAME>.md` - manually referenced per prompt

> Prompts stay thin. Agent files carry all behavioral detail.
> Example: `Use agents/UI.md. Task: build the activity table component.`

## CONTRACTS.md Protocol

Single source of truth for all types and enums shared across projects.
Never duplicated inside any project folder.

- Any agent may **read** `CONTRACTS.md` and `shared/` freely
- No agent may **write** to either unilaterally
- To propose a change, the agent must stop and surface:

```
## CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL
Agent     : <agent name>
File      : CONTRACTS.md or shared/<path>
Change    : <what is being added, modified, or removed>
Reason    : <why this change is needed>
Impact    : <which other agents or projects are affected>
```

Awaits explicit human approval before proceeding.

<!-- @annotation: Default ratification is human-only. Update if your workflow differs. -->

---

## Coordination Rules

1. **Domain isolation** - each agent writes only within its assigned project folder.
2. **Shared is read-only** - no writes to `shared/` without a ratified proposal.
3. **No cross-domain assumptions** - use `CONTRACTS.md` as the handshake between agents.
4. **One branch per agent** - branch = agent + task scope. Never reuse.
5. **worktrees/ is not committed** - add to `.gitignore`.

<!-- @annotation: Add project-specific coordination rules here if needed. -->

---

## Safety Rules

- **Never delete or overwrite** `CONTRACTS.md`, `shared/`, or another agent's files
- **Never commit directly** to `main` or any protected branch
- **Never skip the proposal step** when a contract change is required
- **Stop and flag** any task that requires touching another agent's domain

---

## Session Start

This section fires at the start of every new Claude Code session.
Regardless of what the user types first - even a single word or greeting -
the agent must:

1. Read `BUILD_STATE.md` at the repo root - understand what has been built
2. Check if `TASK.md` exists in the current directory
3. If yes - read it and verify dependencies are met against BUILD_STATE.md
4. If dependencies not met - surface what is missing and propose options
5. If dependencies met - begin executing the task defined in TASK.md
6. If no TASK.md - inform the user to run `node .workflow/launch.js`

Do not wait for explicit instructions.
The presence of `TASK.md` in the worktree is the instruction.

## Autonomy Rules

When executing a task from `TASK.md`, operate in fully autonomous mode:

- **New files only** - proceed without asking for confirmation
- **Modifying existing files** - confirm before proceeding
- **Deleting files** - always confirm before proceeding
- **Do not stop** to ask for plan confirmation unless a destructive action is detected
- **Do not interrupt** the agentic flow with clarifying questions unless the task
  is genuinely ambiguous after reading all available context files

## Implicit Task Clarity Rule

This rule applies to ALL agents and overrides individual Pre-flight Check 1 strictness.

Before flagging a task as ambiguous, the agent must first attempt to derive intent from:

1. **Agent domain** - what this agent is responsible for (UI = components/layout, LOGIC = state/API, etc.)
2. **@config values** - the confirmed stack defines what to build and how
3. **BUILD_STATE.md** - current project state defines what exists and what's next
4. **Scope** - the worktree scope (.claude-scope) defines the boundary

If all four sources together make the intent clear - proceed autonomously.
Only flag for clarification if the task remains genuinely ambiguous AFTER reading all four.

**Examples of implicitly clear tasks:**
- UI agent + empty client/ + full @config + "build the ui" → scaffold the configured stack
- LOGIC agent + scaffold done + STATE: Zustand + "set up state" → implement Zustand stores
- TESTING agent + framework set + "set up tests" → configure test runner for the framework
- ROUTING agent + scaffold done + "set up routing" → configure App Router / routing conventions
- FORMS agent + LOGIC done + "build forms" → implement form architecture with configured libraries

**Examples that still require clarification:**
- "build the ui" with no @config set → framework unknown, cannot proceed
- "add a component" with no description → which component, what purpose
- Any task touching another agent's domain → flag and redirect
