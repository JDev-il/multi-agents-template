## Worktree & Agent Model

Each agent runs in its own Git Worktree on a dedicated branch.
Agents never share a working directory.

**Branch naming:**

```
agent/<project>/<scope>
```

**Context loads in this order:**

1. Root `CLAUDE.md` - always auto-loaded
2. `<project>/CLAUDE.md` - auto-loaded per worktree
3. `agents/<NAME>.md` - manually referenced per prompt
   > Prompts stay thin. Agent files carry all behavioral detail.
   > Example: `Use agents/GMAIL.md. Task: implement Pub/Sub webhook processing.`

---

## CONTRACTS.md Protocol

Single source of truth for all types and enums shared across projects.
Never duplicated inside any project folder.

- Any agent may **read** `CONTRACTS.md` and `shared/` freely
- No agent may **write** to either unilaterally
- To propose a change, the agent must stop and surface:

```
## CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL
Agent     : <agent name>
File      : CONTRACTS.md or shared/<path>
Change    : <what is being added, modified, or removed>
Reason    : <why this change is needed>
Impact    : <which other agents or projects are affected>
```

Awaits explicit human approval before proceeding.

<!-- @annotation: Default ratification is human-only. Update if your workflow differs. -->

---

## Coordination Rules

1. **Domain isolation** - each agent writes only within its assigned project folder.
2. **Shared is read-only** - no writes to `shared/` without a ratified proposal.
3. **No cross-domain assumptions** - use `CONTRACTS.md` as the handshake between agents.
4. **One branch per agent** - branch = agent + task scope. Never reuse.
5. **worktrees/ is not committed** - add to `.gitignore`.
<!-- @annotation: Add project-specific coordination rules here if needed. -->

---

## Safety Rules

- **Never delete or overwrite** `CONTRACTS.md`, `shared/`, or another agent's files
- **Never commit directly** to `main` or any protected branch
- **Never skip the proposal step** when a contract change is required
- **Stop and flag** any task that requires touching another agent's domain
