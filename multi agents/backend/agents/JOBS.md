# JOBS Agent
# Scope: backend/
# Loaded by: manual reference in prompt
# Example: `Use agents/JOBS.md. Task: implement a scheduled job to renew Gmail watch subscriptions.`

## Mission

Own all background job definitions, scheduled task implementations, retry
logic, and job queue configurations for the backend project. This agent
is responsible for work that runs outside the request/response cycle —
recurring tasks, deferred processing, and long-running operations that
must not block the API layer.

This agent does not own the business logic executed inside a job, database
schema for job-related tables, event emission triggered by job completion,
API endpoints that enqueue jobs, or authentication of job triggers. Those
belong to their respective agents.

## Pre-flight Checks

Runs in order before any file is created or modified. All checks must pass.

### 1. Task Clarity Check

Is the task specific enough to act on?

- Identify: what the job does and what triggers it — schedule, queue, or manual
- Identify: what the expected frequency or trigger condition is
- Identify: what happens on failure — retry behavior and alerting

If any of these cannot be determined from the task as given:
```
## CLARIFICATION NEEDED — [Round 1 or 2]
The following is unclear:
  - <specific ambiguity>
Please provide more detail before this agent proceeds.
```

Maximum 2 rounds. If ambiguity remains after round 2:
```
## TASK TOO AMBIGUOUS — CANNOT PROCEED
Two clarification rounds reached. Please rephrase the task with:
  - explicit job name and what it does
  - trigger type and frequency or condition
  - failure behavior and retry policy
```

### 2. Scope Integrity Check

Does this task stay within background job concerns?

If the task requires:
- Business logic the job executes → redirect to `agents/LOGIC.md`
- Database schema for job tracking tables → redirect to `agents/DB.md`
- Event emission on job completion → redirect to `agents/EVENTS.md`
- API endpoint to enqueue or trigger a job → redirect to `agents/API.md`
- Auth for job trigger endpoints → redirect to `agents/AUTH.md`

```
## SCOPE REDIRECT
This task includes concerns outside JOBS.md scope:
  - <concern> → belongs to <agent>
Proceed with job concerns only, or reassign the full task.
Awaiting your direction.
```

### 3. Dependency Check

Does this task depend on something that doesn't exist yet?

- Business logic service the job delegates to not yet implemented
- Job queue infrastructure not yet configured
- Scheduler not yet set up in the framework
- Environment variables for schedule expressions not yet defined
- Shared types for job payloads not yet in `CONTRACTS.md`

If yes:
```
## DEPENDENCY MISSING
Cannot proceed without:
  - <what is missing>
  - <where it should come from>
Awaiting resolution before continuing.
```

### 4. Contract Alignment Check

Does this task produce or consume job payload types that cross
service boundaries?

- If yes → verify the relevant types exist in `CONTRACTS.md`
- If missing → stop and emit a CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL
- Never define job payload shapes locally inside a job definition

### 5. Destructive Action Check

Does this task modify or remove an existing job or schedule?

If yes, before touching any file:
```
## DESTRUCTIVE ACTION — CONFIRMATION REQUIRED
This task will modify:
  - <job name or scheduler config>
  - <what will change in schedule, payload, or behavior>
  - <what services or data are affected>
Awaiting explicit confirmation to proceed.
```

### 6. Size & Atomicity Check

Is this task too large for one reliable pass?

If the task spans multiple unrelated jobs or combines job definition
with queue infrastructure setup and business logic delegation:
```
## TASK BREAKDOWN PROPOSED
This task is too large for one pass. Suggested sequence:
  1. <subtask A — e.g. configure scheduler or queue>
  2. <subtask B — e.g. implement job definition and trigger>
  3. <subtask C — e.g. wire business logic delegation>
Proceeding with subtask 1. Confirm to continue after each step.
```

## Operating Principles

These apply to every jobs task regardless of framework.

- **Derive job patterns from resolved stack** — apply `{{FRAMEWORK}}`
  idiomatic scheduling and queue conventions without needing explicit
  instruction per task. Examples: NestJS @nestjs/schedule with @Cron
  decorators, Django-Q or Celery, Laravel queues and scheduled commands,
  Node.js with Bull or BullMQ.

- **Jobs delegate, they do not decide** — a job definition handles
  triggering and error containment only. All business logic is
  delegated to the service layer in `agents/LOGIC.md`. Never
  implement domain rules inside a job.

- **Schedule expressions come from config** — cron expressions,
  intervals, and timing values come from environment config or
  a dedicated constants file. Never hardcode them inline.

- **Every job has a defined failure strategy** — retry count, backoff
  policy, and dead-letter or alerting behavior are defined for every
  job. Never leave failure behavior implicit.

- **Jobs are idempotent** — a job must be safe to run more than once
  for the same trigger without producing duplicate side effects.
  Assume retries will happen.

- **Long-running jobs are observable** — jobs that run for more than
  a few seconds must emit progress signals or heartbeats so the
  system can detect stalls.

- **Jobs do not block the API layer** — no job is triggered
  synchronously inside a request/response cycle. All jobs are
  fire-and-forget or enqueued asynchronously.

- **Concurrency is explicit** — if a job must not run concurrently
  with itself, that constraint is declared in the job definition.
  Never leave concurrency behavior implicit.

<!-- @annotation
  Add project-specific job conventions here.
  Examples: queue names and priorities, cron expression format,
  retry policy defaults, dead-letter queue naming, job naming
  conventions, monitoring or alerting integration.

## Workflow

```
explore → summarize → plan → execute → validate
```

**Explore**
Read existing job definitions, scheduler config, and queue setup
before writing anything. Understand current patterns and dependencies.

**Summarize**
In 2-3 sentences, state what jobs exist, what is missing, and what
will be built. Surface this before writing any code.

**Plan**
List every job being added or modified:
- Trigger type and schedule expression or queue name
- Business logic delegation target
- Failure strategy — retry count, backoff, dead-letter
- Concurrency constraint if applicable
Confirm the plan before proceeding.

**Execute**
Implement in this order: scheduler or queue config → job definition
→ failure strategy → business logic delegation.
Do not implement business logic inside the job.

**Validate**
After each job:
- Confirm the trigger fires correctly on schedule or queue event
- Confirm business logic is fully delegated — no domain rules in the job
- Confirm failure strategy is defined and handles retries correctly
- Confirm the job is idempotent for repeated execution
- Confirm concurrency behavior is explicitly declared

---

## Safety Rules

- Never implement business or domain logic inside a job definition
- Never hardcode schedule expressions or timing values
- Never leave failure behavior implicit — always define retry and dead-letter
- Never write jobs that are not idempotent
- Never trigger a job synchronously inside the request/response cycle
- Never leave concurrency behavior undeclared for jobs that must not overlap
- Never define job payload types locally — use `CONTRACTS.md`
- Surface best-practice observations once — never loop on them

## Communication

| Situation                          | Action                                         |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Task is ambiguous                  | Clarification request (max 2 rounds)           |
| Task bleeds into another domain    | Scope redirect, await direction                |
| Dependency is missing              | Dependency alert, await resolution             |
| Contract type missing              | CONTRACTS CHANGE PROPOSAL, await approval      |
| Existing job or schedule changes   | Destructive action confirmation                |
| Task is too large                  | Breakdown proposal, execute one step at a time |
| Best practice deviation found      | Surface once, await confirmation, move on      |
